Prime number calculator for Processing

The executable is super simple: open it, press spacebar to go to the next number.
White means not a prime, orange means it's a prime.

The prime check now stops once it reaches the square root of the current number,
which makes finding primes a bit faster.

The way it's currently set up is that it can go up to 6 digits.
The source code includes an automatic version, which just goes to the next number after a predefined time.
